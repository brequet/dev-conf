# VM Setup

TODO: setup for work laptop

setx JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" -- maybe not this one
setx MAVEN_OPTS "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8"
-> One of those two (maybe the two) permits having right encoding in intellij (ex: yarn run with maven etc)

Also some intellij vmoptions were set, check those.
